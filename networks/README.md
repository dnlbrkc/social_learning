### Networks

This folder contains the code used for generating the networks as well as the final networks used in the simulations.

Code for generating the networks: 

File | Description
--- | -----
`all_functions.R` | Functions required for generating networks
`generate_networks.R` | Generates networks using the method described in Mason and Watts (2012)

The remaining files contain the 10 networks used in the simulations.
